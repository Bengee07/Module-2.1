**Simpliest Meaning**

In order to provide quicker innovation, adaptable resources, and scale economies, cloud computing, in its simplest form, is **the supply of computing services via the Internet ("the cloud")**, encompassing servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Typically, you only pay for the cloud services you actually use, which lowers operational expenses, improves infrastructure management, and enables you to scale as your company's needs evolve.


**History of Cloud Computing**

The name "cloud computing" has been used since the early 2000s, although the idea of "computing as a service" dates back to the 1960s, when computer bureaus allowed businesses to rent time on mainframes rather than having to purchase one themselves.

These "time-sharing" services were mainly replaced by the development of the personal computer (PC), which made owning a computer much more accessible. This was followed by the emergence of corporate data centers, which allowed businesses to store enormous amounts of data. 

However, in the application service providers, utility computing, and grid computing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the idea of renting access to computer resources has often come up. This was followed by the rise of software as a service and hyperscale cloud-computing companies like Amazon Web Services, after which cloud computing really took off.


**Why is it called cloud computing?**

The location of the service and many other variables, such as the hardware or operating system on which it is running, are key ideas in cloud computing, although they are mostly irrelevant to the user. The public telephone network (and later the internet) were frequently depicted as clouds in ancient telecoms network diagrams to indicate that the location didn't matter â€” it was just a cloud of things. With this in mind, the metaphor of the cloud was derived from these schematics. Of course, this oversimplifies the situation; for many consumers, the location of their services and data continues to be a major concern.

## Part 2 - Benefit of Cloud Computing

A significant change from how organizations have traditionally viewed IT resources is cloud computing. The following are prevalent among businesses for using cloud computing services: 

**Cost**

With cloud computing, there is no longer a need to invest in hardware, software, the infrastructure of on-site datacenters, including the server racks, round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and IT professionals to oversee the infrastructure. It quickly adds up. 

**Speed**

The majority of cloud computing services are self-service and on-demand, making it possible to provision even large quantities of computing resources quickly and generally with only a few mouse clicks. This gives enterprises a great deal of flexibility and relieves the burden of capacity planning. 

**Global Scope**

The flexibility of scaling is one of the advantages of cloud computing services. In the context of the cloud, this refers to providing the appropriate level of IT resources at the appropriate time and from the appropriate location, such as more or less processing power, storage, and bandwidth. 

**Productivity**

Hardware installation, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management tasks are frequently needed for on-site datacenters. Many of these duties are no longer necessary thanks to cloud computing, freeing up IT employees' time to focus on more crucial business objectives. 

**Performance**

The largest cloud computing services are powered by a global network of safe datacenters that are routinely updated with the newest models of quick and effective computing gear. In comparison to a single corporate datacenter, this has a number of advantages, including lower network latency for applications and greater economies of scale. 

**Reliability**

Due to the fact that data can be replicated at numerous redundant sites on the network of the cloud provider, cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity simpler and less expensive. 

**Security**

A wide range of rules, tools, and controls are provided by many cloud service providers, strengthening your overall security posture and defending your infrastructure, apps, and data from potential threats.

## Part 3 - Cloud Computing VS Traditional Computing

Cloud computing is a lot more ethereal than traditional virtual hosting. All servers, software, and networks are housed in the cloud, off-site, and not via physical hardware. It is a concurrently hosted real-time virtual environment spread across numerous separate servers. Therefore, you can rent data storage space from cloud computing companies on a more cost-effective pay-per-use basis rather than investing money into buying physical servers in-house.

The following are the primary differences:

**Resilience and Elasticity**

The servers connected to function as a single unit are evenly distributed with respect to the data and applications hosted in the cloud. As a result, downtime is avoided and no data is lost if one server fails. Additionally, the cloud provides better server resources, including more storage space, and computing power. Your software and applications will operate more quickly as a result.

A consistently high level of server performance cannot be guaranteed by traditional IT systems because they are not as resilient. Because of their capacity limitations and vulnerability to outages, they can significantly reduce workplace productivity.

**Flexibility and Scalability**

Compared to conventional data centers, cloud computing provides a higher level of flexibility and scalability. Cloud computing's on-demand virtual environment has more server resources and limitless storage space. Depending on the volume of traffic to your website, cloud servers can scale up or down, and you will have full control to install any software whenever you need to. This offers your company more growth potential.

With traditional IT infrastructure, you can only use the resources that are already available to you. If you run out of storage space, the only solution is to purchase or rent another server.If you hire more employees, you will need to pay for additional software licences and have these manually uploaded on your office hardware. This can be a costly venture, especially if your business is growing quite rapidly.

**Automation**

The way they are managed is a significant distinction between traditional IT infrastructure and cloud computing. The storage company manages cloud computing, taking care of all required hardware, making sure security precautions are taken, and keeping everything running smoothly. Traditional data centers demand a lot of internal management, which can be expensive and time-consuming for your company. To ensure regular server monitoring and maintenance, including upgrades, configuration issues, threat protection, and installations, fully trained IT personnel may be required.

**Running Costs**

Because there are more flexible ways to pay for the data storage services provided by the cloud, it is more affordable than traditional IT infrastructure. Similar to how you pay for utilities like electricity, you only pay for the cloud-based services that you use. Additionally, the likelihood of downtime is reduced, which leads to better productivity at work and longer-term revenue growth.

To accommodate business growth with traditional IT infrastructure, you will need to make up-front purchases of hardware and additional server space. You will wind up paying for resources you don't use if this slows down. Additionally, there is a very low return on investment when investing in traditional IT infrastructure because physical servers lose value over time.

**Security**

Because cloud computing stores and delivers data externally, it may appear less secure than local data hosting. Wherever an internet connection is available, anyone with access to the server can view and utilize the programs and data that are stored in the cloud. When moving to the cloud, it is essential to select a cloud service provider that is totally transparent about hosting cloud platforms and guarantees the best security measures are in place.

With traditional IT infrastructure, you are responsible for the protection of your data, and it is easier to ensure that only approved personnel can access stored applications and data. Physically connected to your local network, data centres can be managed by in-house IT departments on a round-the-clock basis, but a significant amount of time and money is needed to ensure the right security strategies are implemented and data recovery systems are in place.

## Part 4 - Hybrid Computing

Applications may run in a variety of different settings as part of a hybrid cloud. Since so few people currently rely only on the public cloud, hybrid cloud computing strategies are widely used. Over the past few decades, many of you have spent millions of dollars and countless hours building on-premises infrastructure. Combining a public and private cloud environment, such as an on-premises data center with a public cloud computing environment, such as Google Cloud, is the most typical hybrid cloud example. We go into how some of you might run a combination of on-premises and various public cloud environments, effectively being both hybrid and multicloud, in the "How-to hybrid" section below.
