## Part 1 - What is Cloud Computing

**Simpliest Meaning**

In order to provide quicker innovation, adaptable resources, and scale economies, cloud computing, in its simplest form, is **the supply of computing services via the Internet ("the cloud")**, encompassing servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Typically, you only pay for the cloud services you actually use, which lowers operational expenses, improves infrastructure management, and enables you to scale as your company's needs evolve.


**History of Cloud Computing**

The name "cloud computing" has been used since the early 2000s, although the idea of "computing as a service" dates back to the 1960s, when computer bureaus allowed businesses to rent time on mainframes rather than having to purchase one themselves.

These "time-sharing" services were mainly replaced by the development of the personal computer (PC), which made owning a computer much more accessible. This was followed by the emergence of corporate data centers, which allowed businesses to store enormous amounts of data. 

However, in the application service providers, utility computing, and grid computing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the idea of renting access to computer resources has often come up. This was followed by the rise of software as a service and hyperscale cloud-computing companies like Amazon Web Services, after which cloud computing really took off.


**Why is it called cloud computing?**

The location of the service and many other variables, such as the hardware or operating system on which it is running, are key ideas in cloud computing, although they are mostly irrelevant to the user. The public telephone network (and later the internet) were frequently depicted as clouds in ancient telecoms network diagrams to indicate that the location didn't matter â€” it was just a cloud of things. With this in mind, the metaphor of the cloud was derived from these schematics. Of course, this oversimplifies the situation; for many consumers, the location of their services and data continues to be a major concern.

## Part 3 - Hybrid Computing

Applications may run in a variety of different settings as part of a hybrid cloud. Since so few people currently rely only on the public cloud, hybrid cloud computing strategies are widely used. Over the past few decades, many of you have spent millions of dollars and countless hours building on-premises infrastructure. Combining a public and private cloud environment, such as an on-premises data center with a public cloud computing environment, such as Google Cloud, is the most typical hybrid cloud example. We go into how some of you might run a combination of on-premises and various public cloud environments, effectively being both hybrid and multicloud, in the "How-to hybrid" section below.
