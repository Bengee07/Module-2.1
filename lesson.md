## Part 1 - What is Cloud Computing

**Simpliest Meaning**

In order to provide quicker innovation, adaptable resources, and scale economies, cloud computing, in its simplest form, is **the supply of computing services via the Internet ("the cloud")**, encompassing servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Typically, you only pay for the cloud services you actually use, which lowers operational expenses, improves infrastructure management, and enables you to scale as your company's needs evolve.


**History of Cloud Computing**

The name "cloud computing" has been used since the early 2000s, although the idea of "computing as a service" dates back to the 1960s, when computer bureaus allowed businesses to rent time on mainframes rather than having to purchase one themselves.

These "time-sharing" services were mainly replaced by the development of the personal computer (PC), which made owning a computer much more accessible. This was followed by the emergence of corporate data centers, which allowed businesses to store enormous amounts of data. 

However, in the application service providers, utility computing, and grid computing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the idea of renting access to computer resources has often come up. This was followed by the rise of software as a service and hyperscale cloud-computing companies like Amazon Web Services, after which cloud computing really took off.
